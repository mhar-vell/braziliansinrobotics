Theoretical analysis is backed by experimental flight tests using a popular commercial quadrotor. Experiments on Commercial Off-The-Shelf Lithium-Polymer batteries, which are the technology dominating the multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle market, are carried out to determine battery run-time and specific energy/capacity models, whilst investigating the battery variability. These battery models are combined with the rotorcraft power model to provide an endurance estimation model, accounting for both battery variability as well as the electric propulsion system effects, which is experimentally validated through flight tests.},

@book{Nonami2010a,
abstract = {Worldwide demand for robotic aircraft such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) is surging. Not only military but especially civil applications are being developed at a rapid pace. Unmanned vehicles offer major advantages when used for aerial surveillance, reconnaissance, and inspection in complex and inhospitable environments. UAVs are better suited for dirty or dangerous missions than manned aircraft and are more cost-effective. UAVs can operate in contaminated environments, for example, and at altitudes both lower and higher than those typically traversed by manned aircraft. Many technological, economic, and political factors have encouraged the development and operation of UAVs. New sensors, microprocessors, and propulsion systems are smaller, lighter, and more capable, leading to levels of endurance, efficiency, and autonomy that exceed human capacities. Comprising the latest research, this book describes step by step the development of small or miniature unmanned aerial vehicles and discusses in detail the integrated prototypes developed at the robotics laboratory of Chiba University. With demonstration videos, the book will interest not only graduate students, scientists, and engineers but also newcomers to the field. {\textcopyright} Springer 2010. All rights are reserved.},

@article{Kendoul2007,
abstract = {Control system design of aerospace vehicles with actuator saturation is an important practical design problem that many previous approaches to nonlinear autopilot design did not consider. In particular, small unmanned aerial vehicle rotorcraft actuators often have physical limitations such as a restricted onboard power supply. Disregard of actuator saturation can affect the final performance, but the reduction in performance can be mitigated if actuator saturation is included in the controller design. In this paper, we propose a nested-saturation-based nonlinear controller for the stabilization of a rotary-wing aircraft This control strategy allows the incorporation of actuator magnitude saturation and has satisfactory dynamic performance. The nested-saturation technique enables the controller to ensure the global asymptotic stability of a quadrotor helicopter while improving the performance of the closed-loop system. By using Lyapunov analysis, the convergence property is established for the complete nonlinear model of the quadrotor rotorcraft. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed control strategy. Using embedded sensors and onboard control, we performed a real-time autonomous flight. Indeed, experimental results have shown that the proposed control strategy is able to autonomously perform the tasks of taking off, hovering, and landing.

abstract = {Quadrotor helicopters are emerging as a popular platform for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) research, due to the simplicity of their construction and maintenance, their ability to hover, and their vertical take off and landing (VTOL) capability. Current designs have often considered only nominal operating conditions for vehicle control design. This work seeks to address issues that arise when deviating significantly from the hover flight regime. Aided by well established research for helicopter flight control, three separate aerodynamic effects are investigated as they pertain to quadrotor flight, due to vehicular velocity, angle of attack, and airframe design. They cause moments that affect attitude control, and thrust variation that affects altitude control. Where possible, a theoretical development is first presented, and is then validated through both thrust test stand measurements and vehicle flight tests using the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control (STARMAC) quadrotor helicopter. The results enabled improved controller performance.},

abstract = {Vision-based quadrotor will be a good carrier for big data. This paper investigates the quadrotor tracking control by designing an adaptive sliding mode controller based on the backstepping technique with the advantages of simplicity in design and ease of application. A sliding mode controller is first developed to ensure fast convergence speed with the desired reference, and then the backstepping technique is used until the desired reference trajectory is achieved and finally the appropriate control laws are obtained. In order to achieve the precise and fast localization of a quadrotor, a popular visual odometry algorithm is applied to gathering good position information required in motion estimation. We employ Kalman filter for sensor data fusion and state estimation. Gazebo is applied by creating a 3D dynamic environment to recreate the complex environment potentially encountered in the real world.},
